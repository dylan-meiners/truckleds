# truckleds

A system for displaying effects on addressable LEDs.
When an effect/warning mode is not active, the tailgate LEDs will default play effects relating to the blinkers and brakes.

The system used to control the lights is an app for iOS called Interface (not on the app store). It connects over bluetooth to a Raspberry Pi running a Node.JS server, which communicates to an arduino over a serial connection.

Code documentation to come.
